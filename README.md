# CS-201
This repository holds most of the code I wrote during my Computer Science 201 class at the University of Alabama.

## Projects

Throughout the course, we worked on three main projects, each centered around implementing a distinct data structure.

### Phase 1: Circular Dynamic Array

In Phase 1, we delve into the Circular Dynamic Array data structure. This template class provides a dynamic array that wraps around itself, allowing for efficient operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Phase 2: 2-3-4 Tree

Phase 2 introduces the 2-3-4 Tree data structure. This template class implements a self-balancing tree, capable of handling dynamic datasets while maintaining optimal performance for operations like insertion, deletion, and search.

### Phase 3: Lazy Binomial Heap

In Phase 3, we explore the Lazy Binomial Heap data structure. This template class offers a heap implementation with lazy evaluation techniques, optimizing performance for heap operations like insertion, extraction, and merging.

Each phase builds upon the previous one, offering a comprehensive understanding of data structures and their implementations.
